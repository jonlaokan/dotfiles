# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like our shell, ~/.bashrc, our editor in ~/.vimrc, and many others. 
They are called *dotfiles* because they usually start with a `.` which hides them on your system.

These are my ever evolving configuration files that I might spend too much time on, feel free to use anything that you find here :smirk:.
