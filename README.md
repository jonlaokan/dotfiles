# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like our shell, ~/.bashrc, our editor in ~/.vimrc, and many others. They are called *dotfiles* because they usually start with a `.` which hides them on your system. Since those files are mostly plain-text files, it's really easy to use a git repository to track the changes over time.
